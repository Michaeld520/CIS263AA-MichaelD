In addition to being an amazing version control tool, GitHub makes for an amazing way to assemble a portfolio
to demonstrate a working understanding of what employers are looking for. By creating a repository for work on
GitHub, it allows future employees to see skill and knowledge used to create working projects. It can also allow
them to see the steps used to create, change, and get a project to its end result.

To make this even better, GitHub pages allows someone to take a repository and transforms it from what could be
considered a difficult to read information and turns it into an easy to read and well-designed website. This not
only helps demonstrate the knowledge the employee is looking for, but also shows a dedication and passion for the
work being completed. Although this alone cannot guarantee a position, it will go far in impressing future employers.
