The IDE I have decided to use for this course is IntelliJ. My main reason for using this IDE is my prior
experience with this IDE. After using JGrasp for the first Java course I took at Rio Salado I began an
Udemy course in order to learn to code with Java. This course was designed around the use of IntelliJ.
In addition to teaching Java, this course also had demonstrations on IntelliJ itself and made it easier to
follow along with the instructor. Besides just having experience, I feel IntelliJ is also not missing some
simpler features that are not present in JGrasp such as the real time error information. All of these factors
lead me to choose IntelliJ over JGrasp and other IDEs on the market.
